                    The guess is any number between 1 and 100, 
                    making it almost impossible to win the game, 
                    especially twice in a row
                </li>
                <li>The player has just three guesses under
                    his belt to tell what number is there. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    After the first two tries, the player is told he is wrong
                    if he is, and given a third try to guess the number.
                    if he is still wrong, he loses the round and 0 is added to
                    his scoreboard, with 1 added to the number of games he's played.
                </li>
                <li>
                    After the player fails a round, the hidden number for that round is shown
                </li>
                <li>
                    The 'Play Game' button displays the game section in favour
                    of the rules section. The 'See Rules' button does the opposite.
                </li>
                <li>
                    On inputting any guess, the user must click on the 'Check' button
                    to see whether they are correct.
                </li>
                <li>The reset button is used to reboot the game, killing everything
                    that has previously been recorded up to that time.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The 'Quit Game' button removes the game section from display.
                    The 'Quit Rules' button removes the rules section from display.
                    <br>Activating one section automatically disables the other.
                </li>
                <li>Goodluck to the player!</li>
